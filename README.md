This simple project describes a fictitious gopher, that moves around a field based on cardinal points, hopefully without falling in any of the ditches which sit around the edge. The gopher moves by issuing commands to it (although this role is played by the test at the moment). Currently there are only two commands: "Forwards" and "Turn Clockwise". In the future there'll probably be more like "Reverse" but we don't want you to implement that right now.

What we would like you to do is refactor the code for us. We like to use Golang best practices, and well formed OO code. 

***Big Hint: There's a reason we call it the IffyGopher: we don't like to many conditionals.***

Remember to keep communicating your thought process, as it will help us understand your approach.

Good Luck!
